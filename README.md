## Visual-Design
 Fonts:
 I decided on using the OSWALD font for the whole page.
 I personally feel the Oswald font is quite striking, and bold. 
 The text is solid & definite, it is giving the User information that they may then applicate. So it needs to be direct & clear, I personally feel Oswald offers that visually.

 ## Icons 
 * I used the website https://fontawesome.com/ for the icones in use on the site.
 * They are utilised as classes in the <i> tag.
 * I used them for company-ethos on the first page. 
 * They are also uses for socials in the footer.

 ![Icon4](assets/images/Icon4.png) 

 ## Colours

 * I wanted the site to have an exciting aesthetic. The city of Barcelona is very passionate, & warm. The colours I've used on the site connect with that also the tradtional colours of the football kit. 
 * The primary colour used is an offwhite. Just to keep everything readable & not overwhelming as a lot of the colours are very bright in the images due to La Masia's kit colours. 
 * There's 2 constant reoccuring colours they are blue and peach. They are contrasting & compliment each other, where strong titles are in blue, the form for example which is the main feature of the 2nd page is in the peach colour.
 * Text is primarily written in a slick gray colour to strike against the off white background & to keep the website professional. 
 * The Title has a 2 tone of yellow and orange to capture the feel of the La Masia shirt within the title. 

![Colours](assets/images/Websitecolours.png) 


## Images 
* The site is very image heavy. I have tried to capture images of famous players aswell as facillities & the youth team. 
* They can easily be seen on any device, though their size does adjust on a few of them you still capture the richness and meaning of the image even with the resize. 
* They are spaced out with text to give every image it's significant moment leadings the users thought pattern until the photo collage on the 2nd page. 


## Features

Page Elements

Elements that cover all pages.

* 1. The Nav Bar

#BREAKING DOWN THE MAIN CONTENT. 

## Page1

The Welcome Image:


The first thing the user connects to is the welcome image. 
The image chosen tells you what La Masia is straight away. 
A football pitch in sight, team work & numbers on the back of the shirt, two players walking back asif they've scored a goal. 
An eclectic mix of colours which are pleasing on the eye. 
* The image has a 2 second zoom.
* The image changes size depending on responsivness but keeps the richness and meaning alive.

![welcomeimage](assets/images/welcomeimage.png)



Middle of the page #1:

"Why La Masia"? Question.
Bring in the user with a question to keep them intrigued to reading more.
Bring a boldness to the colouring and font so the question feels direct to the user. 


Middle Image:

The Youth of La Masia celebrating after a goal.
This leads us into the middle section of the page company culture split into 3 different paragraphs.  
Keeping it exciting, the first image brings a calmness in contrast, the 2nd image is the youth celebrating a goal- bringing togetherness & a feeling of unity to the wesbite.

Company culture:

1- Scholarships: 

2- Coaching

3- Graduation 

*The text changes with responsivness, then line layout becomes smaller making it adapatable for the smaller screens. 

 


About section: 
Once the company ethos is understood, if the user is to continue reading they can go into a bit more depth with an overall picture of La Masia.
Catch a bit of brief history, explain the structure of La Masia & encourage you to apply if you're looking at the page for this reason .

There is a contrasting colour to the background, using grey with the text keeping it slick and professional so when the User knows there's more serious detailed information it shown in more of a regular colour.

The last image: 

This captures one of the greatest ever footballers, that being the last thing the user looks at, Lionel Messi completly captures what La Masia is about going through the youth team into a 15 year + professional contract at elite level football. 
So what better than to finish the home page with the greatest example.

## PAGE 2 RESPONSIVENESS

![page2responsiveness](assets/images/responsivenesspage2.png)


Heading: "Apply now for La Masa" 
This encourages the user to take action, with a well displayed form beneath it.


Form: 
* The form has a peach colour to it and white writing to create a stress free feeling for the user with its colour. 
* The instructions are simple, when you get to the gender button. The form is well constructed so you can click one or the other not both. 
* The 2 buttons at the bottom of the form are designed in a different colour so it's clear to the user it's not something to fill in but to take action. 
* The reset button resets the form. 
* The Submit but will take you to the next page.
* The form is adaptable to different sizes.
It keeps its shape & is the main feature/purpose of the page.

![formlaptop](assets/images/formlaptop.png)
![formmobile](assets/images/formmobile.png)


Training image:
* Getting the user used to seeing facillities is important, so they can connect to the day to day life in La Masia & get a sneak peak at the facillities. Doesn't give away too much, but also brings some life to the middle of the page

![facility](assets/images/facility1.png)


Previous student success & photo collage.

* Now driving towards the bottom of the page, I think it's vital for the Academy to mention the key players that have gone on to be successful. This show's proof to anyone wanting to apply, recent graudates and older graduates success. 

* Recgonisable faces create an ease to the user.
  The end of the page again consistent to the first page having a photo to engage with the user the and celebrate it's players.  

![images](assets/images/successimages.png)


## Page 3 Thank You

![images](assets/images/thankyoupage.png)

* This page connects from page 2 & the button redirects the user back to the form.
* It keeps the flow of the website smooth.
* It has clear text informing the user of important information which is why again it's in the grey font.
* It's spaced out clarly so it fills up the page, it's the most simple page of the website. 



## Page 4 Contact Page
![Contactpage](assets/images/ContactResponsiveness.png)

* The contact page is short and sweet, it show's La Masia Locations & Email adresses for contact. 
* With it being important info for the user the grey colour is used which is then contrasted using the peach colour for the adresses. 
* Some people may just be coming on the site for this info, so I tried to keep it as informative as possible.
