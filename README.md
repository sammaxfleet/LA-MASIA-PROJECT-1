Visual Design
 Fonts
 I decided on using the OSWALD font for the whole page.
 I personally feel the Oswald font is quite striking, and bold. 
 The text id bold as I feel the site makes a statement for how succesful the Acadmey is where if it was soft & light it wouldn't really capture the winning/boldness of La Masia.

 Colours

 * I wanted the site to have an exciting aesthetic. The city of Barcelona is very passionate, & warm. The colours I've used on the site connect with that.
 * The primary colour used is an offwhite. Just to keep everything readable & not overwhelming as a lot of the colours are very bright in the images due to La Masia's kit colours. 
 * There's 2 constant reoccuring colours they are blue and peach, the compliment each other, where strong titles are in blue, the form for example which is the main feature of the 2nd page is in the peach colour.
 * Text is primarily written in a slick gray to strike against the off white background. & to keep the website professional. 
 * The Title has a 2 tone of yellow and orange to capture the feel of the La Masia shirt within the title.

Images 
* The site is very image heavy. I have tried to capture images of famous players aswell as facillities & the youth team. 
* They can easily be seen on any device, though their size does adjust on a few of them you still capture the richness and meaning of the image even with the resize. 
* They are spaced out with text to give every image it's moment until the photo collage on the 2nd page.

Breaking down the 4 pages.

The first thing the user connects to is the welcome image. 
The image chosen tells you what La Masia is straight away, a football pitch in sight, team work & numbers on the back of the shirt. 2 players walking back asif they've scored a goal. 
An eclectic mix of colours which are good on the eye.

Middle of the page #1.

"Why La Masia Question"?
Bring in the user with a question to keep them intrigued to reading more.
Bring a boldness to the colouring and font so the question feels direct to the user. 


Middle Image:

The Youth of La Masia celebrating after a goal. This leads us into the middle section of the page company culture split into 3 different paragraphs.  
Keeping it exciting, the first image brings a calmness in contrast the 2nd image is the youth celebrating a goal- bringing togetherness & a feeling of unity to the academy.

Company culture:

1- Scholarships: 

2- Coaching

3- Graduation 

*The text changes with responsivness, then line layout becomes smaller making it adapatable for the smaller screens. 

 


About section: 
Once the company ethos is understood, if the user is to continue reading they can go into a bit more depth with an overall picture of La Masia.
Catch a bit bof brief history, explain the structure of La Masia & encourage you to apply if you're looking at the page for this reason .

There is a contrasting colour to the background, using grey with the text keeping it slick and professional so when the User know there's more serious detailed information it shown in more of a regular colour.

The last image: 

The captures one of the greatest ever footballers. That being the last thing the user looks at, Lionel Messi completly captures what La Masia is about going through the youth ranks into professional football. 
So what better than to finish the home page with the greatest example.
