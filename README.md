La Masia

I wanted to construct a site with colour that captures the vibrant, welcoming, nostalgic colours of Barcelona footbals Club's Academy La Masia. 
La Masia means the FarmHouse in Spanish, it is an iconic football Acadmey where many players of the modern era have learnt their trade. 
The site is targetd at people wanting to join the Academy and know more about it.
