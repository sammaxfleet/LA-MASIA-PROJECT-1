Visual Design
 Fonts
 I decided on using the OSWALD font for the whole page.
 I personally feel the Oswald font is quite striking, and bold. 
 The text id bold as I feel the site makes a statement for how succesful the Acadmey is where if it was soft & light it wouldn't really capture the winning/boldness of La Masia.

 Colours

 * I wanted the site to have an exciting aesthetic. The city of Barcelona is very passionate, & warm. The colours I've used on the site connect with that.
 * The primary colour used is an offwhite. Just to keep everything readable & not overwhelming as a lot of the colours are very bright in the images due to La Masia's kit colours. 
 * There's 2 constant reoccuring colours they are blue and peach, the compliment each other, where strong titles are in blue, the form for example which is the main feature of the 2nd page is in the peach colour.
 * Text is primarily written in a slick gray to strike against the off white background. & to keep the website professional. 
 * The Title has a 2 tone of yellow and orange to capture the feel of the La Masia shirt within the title.
