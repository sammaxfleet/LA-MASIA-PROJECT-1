            La Masia 
The Official Football Academy of Barcelona F.C.
La Masia means the Farmhouse in Spanish, this is where our academy started so we have always paid tribute to the original location.  
The Official Football Academy of Barcelona F.C.
We are established since 1988 & have been a home to some of the best players of the current football era. Our Academy starts full time from ages 8 til 18yr old. The student intake is based on an application process, if selected your are then asked to come for a trial, post trial we award the scholarships &  half scholarships out on very careful selection to what our Academy needs. 
Between 16-18 we guide the students into our pre professional programme. The aim of the Academy is to get as many players on pro contracts in La Liga.
