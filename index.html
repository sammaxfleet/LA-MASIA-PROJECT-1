                <p>
                  La Masia is the Official Football Academy of Barcelona F.C. La
                  Masia means the Farmhouse in Spanish, this is where our
                  academy started so we have always paid tribute to the original
                  location. It is based worldwide in 5 differenct countries (see
                  contact page) We are established since 1988 & have been a home
                  to some of the best players of the current football era. Our
                  Academy starts full time from ages 8 til 18 yr old. The
                  student intake is based on an application process, if selected
                  your are then asked to come for a trial, post trial we award
                  the scholarships & half scholarships out on very careful
                  selection to what our Academy needs. Between 16-18 we guide
                  the students into our pre professional programme. The aim of
                  the Academy is to get as many players on pro contracts in La
                  Liga and to kick start your future as a professional athlete.
